# neuralop-playground

A repository for learning, testing, and experimenting with **Neural Operators (NO)**, including Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) and other PDE-based machine learning models.

Mostly using [`NeuralOperators`](https://neuraloperator.github.io/dev/index.html) library, which is a PyTorch-based library for building and training neural operators.
